# CLI View

We need a way to interact with our `Welcomer` module.
The cli project contains a `Cli` module that renders the app on the terminal and uses `Welcomer` to greet people.

## Tasks:

### Run cli in iex

```
iex -S mix

> Cli.launch()
```

- [ ] Greet the world
- [ ] Greet `yourself`
- [ ] Greet `yourself` with message: `Elixir is awesome!`
